Here’s a straightforward process for making KFC-style fried chicken:

1.	Marinate the chicken: Soak the chicken pieces in buttermilk for 2-4 hours (overnight if possible).
2.	Prepare flour coating: Mix flour with a blend of 11 herbs and spices (commonly salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and others).
3.	Dredge the chicken: Remove chicken from buttermilk, letting excess drip off. Dip the chicken pieces in the flour mixture, fully coating each piece.
4.	Double dip (optional): For extra crispiness, dip the flour-coated chicken back into the buttermilk, then again into the flour mixture.
5.	Heat the oil: Preheat vegetable oil to 175°C (350°F) in a deep fryer or large pot.
6.	Fry the chicken: Fry the chicken in small batches for about 12-15 minutes until golden brown and fully cooked inside (internal temperature of 75°C or 165°F).
7.	Drain and rest: Remove the chicken and place it on a rack or paper towels to drain excess oil.

Enjoy your crispy KFC-style fried chicken!
